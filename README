    PostgreyLDAP - an LDAP Backed Postfix policy server for greylisting
    ====================================================================

Based heavily on Postgrey, version 2.0alpha1.

INSTALL

Quick Start

- Extend your LDAP schema to include the required attributes and object classes.
  See ldap/README for details
  
- Configure an LDAP account for PostgreyLDAP, and (ideally) create an OU for 
  postgreyldap to use, which the PostgreyLDAP account has access to.  
  
- Configure postgreyldap from the provided exmaple config.dist file

- Have postgreyldap start as a system service.

- Possibly migrate file-based whitelists into LDAP.
 

Why?

Greylisting is a given, but I have multiple redundant front end mail servers. 
I'd like their greylist database to be shared, and I currently know of no shared 
greylisting systems. Google diddn't turn up anything. I suppose that Postgrey 
itself can listen on the network (so, in turn, can PostgreyLDAP), but this 
introduces a single point of failure.

Using Postfix, and OpenSuSE, virtually all of the "dynamic" configuration of my
mail servers is stored in LDAP. LDAP is shared, and distributed, and can handle 
failures, while continuing to have write access to LDAP. As of OpenLDAP version 
2.4 multi-master replication is supported, and easy to configure. 

I'm sure that I could get e.g. MySQL to do this, but I'm not running it at all
on my MX servers, and I'm sure there are others out there with the desire for 
shared greylisting and who have, or could easily configure, a robust LDAP 
infrastructure.


Why not BerkeleyDB (as per Postgrey <2.0), or SQLITE?

They aren't distributed.

So why not NFS?

I don't want to - can't - rely on a single NFS server for greylisting to work.

Why not MySQL or PostgreSQL?

- My front end routers/MX servers are not currently running either.
- I have no experience with replicated SQL, and especially no experience with 
multiple-master replicated SQL.

Why LDAP?

I have multiple mail servers. OpenSuSE (YaST), Postfix, and OpenLDAP make it 
very easy to use LDAP as the backend for dynamic mail configuration already, 
which I'm using. OpenSuSE and OpenLDAP make it very easy to configure 
distributed, replicated, LDAP services.
